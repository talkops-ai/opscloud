description: Create a git commit. Use whenever you are about to create a commit, whether the user asked for one or it is a step in your current task — it gathers git context and applies the required commit workflow (message style, staging rules, safety protocol).
argument-hint: "[guidance]"
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive git commands (`push --force`, `reset --hard`, `checkout .`, `restore .`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`) unless the user explicitly requests these actions
- NEVER skip hooks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, etc.) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER force push to `main`/`master`; warn the user if they request it
- CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending, unless the user explicitly requests a `git amend`. When a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did NOT happen — so `--amend` would modify the PREVIOUS commit, which may result in destroying work or losing previous changes. Instead, after hook failure, fix the issue, re-stage, and create a NEW commit
- When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than using `git add -A` or `git add .`, which can accidentally include sensitive files (`.env`, `credentials`) or large binaries
- Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, etc.). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files
- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit
- Never use git commands with the `-i` flag (like `git rebase -i` or `git add -i`) since they require interactive input which is not supported
- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit:

1. Analyze the changes and draft a commit message:
   - Look at the recent commits above to follow this repository's commit message style
   - Summarize the nature of the changes (new feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)
   - Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.)
   - Draft a concise (1–2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"

2. Stage the relevant files and create the commit. To ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message inline via a HEREDOC, never from a file or template (`-F`, `--file`, and `-t` should not be used):
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message here.
EOF
)"
```

3. Run `git status` after the commit completes to verify it succeeded.

4. If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook: fix the issue, re-stage, and create a NEW commit. Never use `--amend` or `--no-verify` to get past a failing hook.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. Stage and create the commit using a single message. Do not run additional commands to read or explore code beyond the git context above unless a pre-commit hook fails.
